IWM Trace
=========

Internet Weather Map (IWM) aggrigates traces from around the world and displays them in map and table format. IWM's members each run this small bash script once a minute on a linux server. This script pulls down a list of IPs to trace to, performs the traces, and then pushes back up your results to our servers. All automated, and with very little system load.

If you're interested in feeding data to the map, you can request an account via http://www.internetweathermap.com/user/login and the "Request an Account" tab.

For more information on what the map looks like, see http://www.internetweathermap.com/map
