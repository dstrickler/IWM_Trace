IWM Bash script
===============

Internet Weather Map (IWM) aggrigates traces from around the world and displays them in map and table format. IWM's members each run this small script once a minute on a linux server. This script that allows you to pull down a list of IPs to trace to, and then push back up your results. All automated, and with very little system load.
